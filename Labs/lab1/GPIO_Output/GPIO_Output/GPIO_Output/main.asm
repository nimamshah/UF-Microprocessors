 This program shows how to initialize a GPIO port on the Atmel 
 (Port D for this example) and demonstrates various ways to write to 
 a GPIO port.  The output will blink LEDs at the bottom left of the 
 uPAD, labeled D5.  PortD0, PortD1, and PortD4 are the red, green, 
 and blue LEDs,  respectively.  Note that these LEDs are active-low.
