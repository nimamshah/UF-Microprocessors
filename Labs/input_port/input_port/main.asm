 * This is the minimum code required to setup an input port with
 * address decoding utilizing both the CS of the XMEGA and the CPLD. This 
 * solution assumes the user is providing their own output enable, OE(L), 
 * to the input port's tri-state buffer chip using CS0(L) and RE(L), i.e., 
 * OE(from CPLD to tri-state buffer) = f(CS0,RE).
